[0.8.0 - 2014/06/23]
+ Lots of changes, some of them might brake your current code, ask in the project discussion board in case of doubt.
+ Added ModelSpace and PaperSpace, now it is possible to work in model space and paper space through layouts. See the PaperSpace() sample in the TestDxfDocument project.
+ Added Layouts.
+ Added PlotSettings.
+ Added Viewports.
+ Added Transparency to Layers and Entities.
+ Added method PlainText() to MText class that will return the text without the formatting codes.
+ Added the drawing variables $TDCREATE, $TDUCREATE, $TDUPDATE, and $TDUUPDATE; that control the drawing creation and last update in local and universal time(UTC).
+ Added the drawing variable $TDINDWG that control the drawing editing time.
+ Now you can set the document and block drawing units, and image units. See the DocumentUnits() sample in the TestDxfDocument project.
+ Reworked the hatch boundary path information, this will also fix a problem with arc boundary paths that were defined CW instead of the common CCW. It still possible to retrieve entities that make the hatch boundary path with the method Hatch.CreateWCSBoundary().
+ Reworked how the entities and attribute definitions are stored in a block. See the BlockWidthAttributes() sample in the TestDxfDocument project.
+ Rename FillType to HatchFillType, BoundaryPathTypeFlag to HatchBoundaryPathTypeFlag, and TableObjects.Values to TableObjects.Items.
+ Some modifications in the Image entity, now the width and height of the image represent the size in world coordinate units.
+ (fixed) MText color formatting option when it was using true color.

[0.7.0 - 2014/04/25]
+ Encoding and decoding of non extended ASCII characters will be done automatically by the DxfWriter and the DxfReader. Dxf versions prior to 2007 need to encode the characters outside the extended ASCII chart (char>255) as \U+#### where #### is a four digits hexadecimal number that represents the character. 
+ Added IsFrozen and IsLocked properties to layers.
+ Workarounds for possible out of range values while importing dxf files.
+ Erased FileNotFound exception in ImageDef constructor, AutoCAD will only show a file not found in case the image is not present.
+ Allow to load files while they are being opened by another process. AutoCAD likes to keep their drawing files opened while working on them.
+ (fixed) Read ACDSDATA section. Undocumented dxf section that seems to affect only the dxf database version 2013 and later.
+ (fixed) The Text and MText height can not be zero or less.
+ (fixed) Read SEQEND object in Insert entities. Drawings with proxy graphics might be affected by this.
+ (fixed) Some TableObject properties of DxfObjects not pointing to the same reference in its corresponding global list.

[0.6.2 - 2014/03/20]
+ All angle values now will be normalized to the range [0,360[. In the case of the ellipse if the start and end angles are equal it will be considered a full ellipse.
+ (fixed) Load dxf files not encoded as utf8, all other files will use the supplied dxf codepage to get the proper encoding.
+ (fixed) Arc.ToPolyline method.
+ (fixed) Ellipse.ToPolyline method.
+ (fixed) Read entity linetype scale value.

[0.6.1 - 2013/11/03]
+ Updated "netDxf Documentation.chm".
+ Rename Attribute definition and Attribute Id to Tag as it is the name given by the dxf documentation.
+ (fixed) Loading dxf files with duplicate attribute definition tags in block attributes. Although AutoCad allows this behaviour this library does not. Having duplicate tags is not recommended in any way, since there will be no way to know which is the definition associated to the insert attribute.
+ (fixed) Load dxf files containing a ThumbnailImage section.
+ (fixed) Load dxf file encoding.
+ (fixed) Big HandleSeed hex numbers. The NumHandles has been changed to long, hopefully this will solve the problem, but I don't know which is the largest handle hex number AutoCad can generate. The BigInteger class of the Net Framework 4.0 will solve this problem but at the moment this library maintains its compatibility with Net 2.0.

[0.6.0 - 2013/09/06]
+ Added Ray entity.
+ Added XLine entity (aka construction line).
+ Added UCS (user coordinate system) table object.
+ Added method Remove(T tableObject) to TableObjects.
+ Added check for not supported characters in table object names. The following characters are not allowed \<>/?":;*|,=`
+ Group now derives from TableObject.
+ Added Groups class derived from TableObjects to control the dxf document groups.
+ Added two methods to the Groups class, Remove deletes the group and the grouped entities and Ungroup deletes the group while keeping the entities in the document.
+ Added IsByLayer and IsByBlock bool properties to AciColor.
+ (fixed) Read Dimension when it was part of a block.
+ (fixed) Read line weight applied to layers.
+ (fixed) Issue Id #12000 Empty font name throw exception. Added workaround dxf files that have empty or null font names on TextStyle definitions.
+ (fixed) Issue Id #12126 Scaled and rotated hatch patterns. Pattern line definition origin needed to be transformed.

[0.5.0 - 2013/07/16]
+ Lots of changes on how the document handles the tables, check the samples or ask in the forum in case of doubt.
+ Added TableObjects class and derivatives for application registries, blocks, dimension styles, layers, line types, multiline styles, text styles, and image definitions collections to uniform its behaviour.
+ Added Remove and Clear methods for table objects. Now it is possible to clean the document from empty layers, blocks without references,...
+ Added GetReferences method for table objects. Now it is possible to get the list of dxf objects that make use of a particular layer, block,...
+ Added CreateWCSBoundary method for hatches, it will generate a list of entities that makes the hatch boundaries expressed in world coordinates.
+ Entities implement IClonable interface.
+ Block now derives from TableObject.
+ ImageDef now derives from TableObject.
+ Updated "netDxf Documentation.chm".
+ (fixed) Image entity not writing code 360 (Hard reference to imagedef_reactor object).
+ (fixed) Read MLine when it was part of a block.

[0.4.7 - 2013/05/28]
+ Added missing Splines property to access the splines list of the DxfDocument.
+ Added missing Dimensions property to access the dimensions list of the DxfDocument.

+ The entity Normal property is now part of the EntityObject base class.
+ (fixed) Polyline IsClosed property.
+ (fixed) Write polyface meshes with a number of vertexes less than three.

[0.4.5 - 2013/05/10]
+ Workaround buggy dxf files with entities that references table objets not defined in the tables section. This only applies to application registries, layers, line types, text styles, dimension styles and mline styles, if necessary a new one with default values will be created.

[0.4.4 - 2013/05/08]
+ Added Add and Get application registries methods.
+ (fixed) Bug in Get table object by name methods.
+ (fixed) Table dictionaries keys will ignore case as it should have been from day one. The names of layers, line types, text styles,... are case insensitive.
+ (fixed) Workarounds for bugs on programs that generate dxfs with duplicate table object names. Duplicate table objects will be skipped.
+ (fixed) Issue Id #11725 CheckDimBlockName. Added check that dimension blocks and group names starts with "*D" and "*A" respectively while reading dxfs.

[0.4.3 - 2013/04/16]
+ Added AutoCad drawing database version number AC1027 = AutoCAD 2013.

+ (fixed) Issue Id #11702 Issue with position of insert attributes.

[0.4.2 - 2013/04/07]
+ Read and write comments only at the head of the dxf file.
+ Workaround/fixes due to inconsistences on dxf files generated by Sketchup and EASE. Now during the attribute initialization all attribute definition properties will be copied, so any changes made to the attribute definition will only be applied to new attribute instances and not to existing ones. This is due to some dxf files might generate INSERT entities that contains attributes that are not defined in the BLOCK, eventhought it might be incorrect, strictly speaking, AutoCad allows this behaviour.
+ (fixed) AutoCad was giving an error with the LastSavedBy Header variable, this variable is not recongnized by AutoCad2000.
+ (fixed) Issue Id #11690 Insert Entity Scale.
+ (fixed) Error reading color in ReadVertex() method.

[0.4.1 - 2013/03/07]
+ Added new header variables that handle the properties applied to new entities.

[0.4.0 - 2013/03/03]
+ Added MLine entity.
+ Added Groups.
+ Added hatch gradient pattern (only supported by AutoCad2004 and higher dxf versions).
+ Now all header variables (version, codepage, handleseed,...) are handled by the HeaderVariables class.
+ The AciColor rgb to index conversion might be a little more accurate now.
+ Added AciColor conversions from and to HSL (hue, saturation, lightness).
+ Deleted parameter DxfVersion from the Save() method of the DxfDocument. Now it is handled by the AcadVer property of the DrawingVariables property of the DxfDocument.
+ DxfDocument.Load() methods are now static, they will return null if errors are found during the loading process.
+ Deleted FileInfo property from the DxfDocument.
+ Updated "netDxf Documentation.chm".
+ (fixed) The true color values were not being read.

[0.3.0 - 2013/02/10]
+ Feature request Id #11534 Add DxfDocument.Save() that takes an output System.IO.StreamDxfDocument, added also DxfDocument.Load() from a stream.
+ Feature request Id #11536 Write lineweight values (group code 370) to DXF. Layers and entities now support lineweight property.
+ Feature request Id #11537 Add support for RGB colors (group code 420). Layers and entities now support true colors.
+ Now you can access the full list of indexed colors.
+ Added linetype scale property (group code 48) to all entities.
+ Added object visibility property (group code 60) to all entities.
+ Added rotation property (group code 50) to Point entity.
+ IEntityObject is now EntityObject an abstract class derived from DxfObject.
+ ITableObject is now an TableObject abstract class derived from DxfObject.
+ (fixed) Error writing indexes of PolyfaceMesh faces.
 
[0.2.8.1 - 2013/01/30]
+ (fixed) Issue Id #11534 Infinite loop loading dxf file.

[0.2.8 - 2013/01/29]
+ The Reader and the Writer now should be able to handle other Ansi code pages than the common 1252 Latin 1; Western European (Windows).
+ Added static function to the DxfDocument to get the string that represents the dxf database version number.
+ Clean up related hatch reader methods a little more.

[0.2.7 - 2013/01/29]
+ Hatches now supports spline as boundary paths.
+ Added SplineVertex constructor with Vector2.
+ Dropped the restriction to use only ASCII characters, now the StreamReader will always use Encoding.Default the equivalent to ANSI_1252 defined in the $DWGCODEPAGE header variable of the dxf file.
+ Deleted ClassDiagram.cd from project.
+ Deleted lots of if(dxfPairInfo.Code == #) statements from Reader.ReadEdgeBoundaryPath(int numEdges) since they are no really need it. The way hatch boundary paths are defined is very strict, you must follow exactly the order and number of elements that appear in the documentation.
+ (fixed) Saving files that has been loaded from a file without defined RasterVariables object.

[0.2.6 - 2013/01/28]
+ Added Image entity.

[0.2.5 - 2013/01/16]
+ Added Spline entity.
+ Added public methods to add and get table objects (Layers, LineTypes, TextStyles, DimensionStyles, and Blocks).
+ Rename Text.BasePoint, MText.InsertionPoint and AttributeDefinition.BasePoint, Block.BasePoint, and Insert.InsertionPoint to .Position.
+ The attribute normal will use the ones applied to the Insert entity to which it belongs, this is subject to change if I find a way to get predictable results.
+ Updated "netDxf Documentation.chm".
+ (fixed) Insertions, Attributes and Text entities follows the same rules as the Circle, Arc, Ellipse and MText entities. The insertion point (position), defines the placement in world coordinates and the normal defines the orientation of the insertion at that point (this will only affect to entities which normal is not the default ZAxis).
+ (fixed) Text aligment in block attributes.

[0.2.4 - 2012/12/19]
+ Now the entity handles are assigned when the entity is added to the document. This should allow to open an existing dxf and add more entities to the same document, while maintaining the old entity handles once the document is saved again.
+ Added Plot property to layers, If set to false, do not plot this layer.
+ Added RemoveEntity method to the DxfDocument.
+ Deleted Layer, Color, and LineType properties from PolyfaceMeshFace, PolyfaceMeshVertex, and PolylineVertex.

[0.2.3 - 2012/12/14]
+ Added read and write Linear Dimensions.
+ Added read and write Radial Dimensions.
+ Added read and write Diametric Dimensions.
+ Added read and write 3 Point Angular Dimensions.
+ Added read and write 2 Line Angular Dimensions.
+ Added read and write Ordinate Dimensions.
The dimension style definition is very limited and the drawing might be buggy under some circunstances (it is sensitive in the order the reference points are given and/or offset negative values).
+ Updated "netDxf Documentation.chm".
+ (fixed) Read code 70 in LwPolylines.
+ (fixed) Read hatch with solid pattern fill.
+ (fixed) Read AttributeDefinition width factor.
+ minor fixes and cleanup.

[0.2.2 - 2012/11/21]
+ Delete property aligment from block attributes, it did not seem to change anything and it was not recognized by AutoCAD 2005 generating an error. AutoCAD 2005 was not able to load a 2004 dxf generated by AutoCAD 2012. It did not recognized the aligment codes.
+ Cleaned up entity constructors.
+ Added entity constructors with Vector2.
+ Added read and write Aligned Dimensions.
- (fixed) AciColor negative index issue when loading files.

[0.2.1 - 2012/11/16] 
+ Added MTEXT entity, with basic text formatting.
+ Move TextAlligment to the netDxf.enties namespace.
+ (fixed) The default text style (Standard) must be the first on the table list.

[0.2.0 - 2012/10/12] 
+ Dropped support for AutoCAD12 dxf files this will break your program if you are using polylines. Important: following the way the dxf calls the polyline entities:
1. - LightWeightPolyline has been renamed LwPolyline for short.
2. - All Polylines are now LwPolylines.
3. - All Polylines3d are now Polylines.
Also the entities LwPolyline, Polyline and PolyfaceMesh have their own list in the DxfDocument, before they all were included in the same list "Polylines".
+ Updated "netDxf Documentation.chm".

[0.1.6.0 - 2012/09/28]
+ Read and write hatches to dxf, there are a few predefined patterns based on AutoCAD pat file. You can create your own providing the information needed for the HatchPatternLineDefinition class or load from a file (same rules as AutoCAD pat files are applied).
+ Line types can be loaded form a file but only simple line patterns are supported (same rules as AutoCAD lin files are applied).
+ Text files reorganization: changelog.txt and license.txt move to doc folder together with the compiled HTML help file.
+ Updated "netDxf Documentation.chm".
+ Added AutoCad2010 database version number.
+ (fixed) Renamed the PolylineVertex and LightweightPolylineVertex StartThickness and EndThickness as StartWidth and EndWidth, it should always be this way. Do not confuse Elevation, Width and Thickness of an entity. I try to follow the AutoCAD documentation as close as possible, please check it in case of doubt or as in this case I might be wrong. 
+ (fixed) Read and write ellipse entity.
+ (fixed) To make it easier and to unify concepts, the center of a circle, an arc and an ellipse are always given in world coordinates, even though the dxf gives the center of the circle and the arc in object coordinates, and the center of the ellipse in world coordinates. The local (to the center) orientation of the entity will be given by the normal.

[0.1.5.0 - 2012/09/21]
+ With limitations now you can write hatches in dxf files.
+ Removed the limitations of the bulge in polyline vertexes, it can actually be greater than 1 and lower than -1 (1 represents the semicircle and the negative sign if the arc goes in or out).

[0.1.4.0 - 2012/09/11]
+ Vector2f, Vector3f, Matrix3f are no loger needed - removed
+ Vector2d renamed to Vector2
+ Vector3d renamed to Vector3
+ Matrix3d renamed to Matrix3

[0.1.3.0 - 2012/09/03]
+ Changed all numeric data of the library to use doubles instead of floats
+ Solution updated to Visual Studio 2010

[0.1.2.0 - 2009/03/07]
+ Added support for AutoCad12, AutoCad2000, AutoCad2004 and AutoCad2007 dxf files
+ The Ellipse entity will be exported as a true ellipse for dxf file version AutoCad2000 and higher
+ Due to the need of keeping unique handles for entities, duplicate objets will not be allowed
+ Added this change log information
+ Added Lightweight entity
+ Lots of internal changes and new classes
+ NurbsCurves will not be allowed temporally, it needs more work to be able to export them as true splines in AutoCad200 and higher dxf files

[0.1.1.0 - 2009/03/01]
+ Added Ellipse entity that will be exported as a polyline in AutoCad12 dxf files
+ Added NubsCurve entity that will be exported as a polyline in AutoCad12 dxf files
